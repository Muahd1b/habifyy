# Community Hub

## Purpose
- Encourage social accountability and gamified motivation through friends, competitions, marketplace, and achievements.

## Primary User Goals
- Connect with other users, track community activity, and manage friendships.
- Join or create competitions to compete on habit performance.
- Spend earned points in the marketplace and view achievement progress.

## Core Sub-Features
1. **Friends** – search, request, leaderboard, messaging entry points.
2. **Competitions** – browse active/upcoming events, join, and track status.
3. **Marketplace** – filter, sort, and purchase rewards with points.
4. **Achievements** – browse earned vs available badges with progress.

## Key States & Edge Cases

- Real-time updates vs polling trade-offs.

## Metrics
- Daily/weekly active community visits.
